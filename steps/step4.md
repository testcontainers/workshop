# Your first Testcontainers integration test

From the Testcontainers website, we learn that there is a simply way of running different supported JDBC databases with Docker:  
https://www.testcontainers.org/usage/database_containers.html

An especially interesting part are JDBC-URL based containers:  
https://www.testcontainers.org/usage/database_containers.html#jdbc-url

It means that starting to use Testcontainers in our project (once we add a dependency) is as simple as changing a few properties in Spring Boot:
```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT, properties = {
 "spring.datasource.url=jdbc:tc:postgresql:10-alpine://testcontainers/workshop",
 "spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.testcontainers.jdbc.ContainerDatabaseDriver"
})
```

If we split the magical JDBC url, we get:
- `jdbc:tc:` - this part says that we should use Testcontainers as JDBC provider
- `postgresql:10-alpine://` - we use a PostgreSQL database, and we select PostgreSQL 10 from the Docker Hub as the image
- `testcontainers/workshop` - the host name (can be anything) is `testcontainers` and the database name is `workshop`. Your choice!

Add the following properties and run the test again. Fixed? Good!

Check the logs.

        ✔ Docker version should be at least 1.6.0

```

As you can see, Testcontainers quickly discovered your environment and connected to Docker. It did some pre-flight checks as well to ensure that you have a valid environment.

## Hint 1:
Add the following line to your `~/.testcontainers.property` file to disable these checks and speed up the tests:
```
checks.disable=true
```

## Hint 2:
Changing the PostgreSQL version is as simple as replacing `10-alpine` with, for example, `9-alpine`. 

Try it, but don't forget that it will download the image from the internet, if it's not already present on your computer.
